NuGet
is a free and open-source package manager designed for the Microsoft development platform (formerly known as NuPack).
Since its introduction in 2010, NuGet has evolved into a larger ecosystem of tools and services.

A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, 
upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.

NuGet is a popular way to depend on code that you don't build. You can download NuGet packages by running the dotnet
restore command either through the .NET Core task or directly in a script in your pipeline.

dotnet restore internally uses a version of NuGet.exe that is packaged with the .NET Core SDK.
dotnet restore can only restore packages specified in the .NET Core project .csproj files. If you also have a
Microsoft .NET Framework project in your solution or use package.json to specify your dependencies, you must also use the 
NuGet task to restore those dependencies.
In .NET Core SDK version 2.0 and newer, packages are restored automatically when running other commands such as dotnet build. 
However, you might still need to use the .NET Core task to restore packages if you use an authenticated feed.
