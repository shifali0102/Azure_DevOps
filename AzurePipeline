Azure Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build and test your code project and make it available to other users.
It works with just about any language or project type.
Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to constantly and consistently test and build your code and ship it to any target.

Languages
You can use many languages with Azure Pipelines, such as Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C#, C++, and Go.

Application types
You can use Azure Pipelines with most application types, such as Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, .NET, C++, Go, PHP, and XCode.

Deployment targets
Use Azure Pipelines to deploy your code to multiple targets. Targets include container registries, virtual machines, Azure services, 
or any on-premises or cloud target.

Package formats
To produce packages that can be consumed by others, you can publish NuGet, npm, or Maven packages to the built-in package management repository in Azure Pipelines.
You also can use any other package management repository of your choice.

The basic steps are these:

1.Configure Azure Pipelines to use your Git repo.
2.Edit your azure-pipelines.yml file to define your build.
3.Push your code to your version control repository. This action kicks off the default trigger to build and deploy and
then monitor the results.
4.Your code is now updated, built, tested, and packaged. It can be deployed to any target.
