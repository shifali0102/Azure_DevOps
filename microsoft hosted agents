If your pipelines are in Azure Pipelines, then you've got a convenient option to run your jobs using a Microsoft-hosted agent.
With Microsoft-hosted agents, maintenance and upgrades are taken care of for you. Each time you run a pipeline, you get a
fresh virtual machine.The virtual machine is discarded after one use.

For many teams this is the simplest way to run your jobs. You can try it first and see if it works for your build or deployment.
If not, you can use a self-hosted agent.

Microsoft-hosted agent pools offer 7 virtual machine images to choose from, each including a broad range of tools and software:
Have the above software. You can also add software during your build or release using tool installer tasks.

Microsoft-hosted agents do not offer:

1. The ability to sign in.
2. The ability to drop artifacts to a UNC file share.
3. The ability to run XAML builds.
4. Potential performance advantages that you might get by using self-hosted agents which might start and run builds faster.
If Microsoft-hosted agents don't meet your needs, then you can deploy your own self-hosted agents.
